    <h1>OTP Analyst</h1>
    <p>OTP Analyst goes beyond passenger information, applying OpenTripPlanner's routing engine to problems in transportation planning, public policy, and the social sciences. The transit system model and optimization logic originally developed for point-to-point searches has been extended to support one-to-many and many-to-many queries in large batches, a foundation upon which we have built a wide range of analytical tools enabling data-driven decision making, alternatives analysis, and public outreach around service changes and infrastructure development. This functionality is built into OTP and available "out of the box" as part of any trip planning deployment.</p>
