    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Conveyal is a consultancy specializing in open data and open source technology for the transport sector. We offer both strategy and implementation services for governments, transport providers, and non-governmental organizations interested in building the next generation of open transport technology, with a particular emphasis on sustainable transport modes and the smarter use of existing transport and data infrastructure. We bring a strong focus on the needs of the end user -- those using the transport system on a daily basis -- to all of our work.</p>
    <p>Our principals offer a unique combination of expertise in urban planning, open government, and information technology, with extensive experience in the development and application of high quality, user-centered tools for open transport data collection, management, analysis, and visualization for clients around the world. While we possess skills in creating software, software itself is not our end product; rather, we leverage technology to achieve improved transport outcomes.</p>
